## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently exploring [CTFs](https://ctftime.org/) and doing open source contributions.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on cool stuff which is not AI :)
- 💬 Ask me about why I am confused all the time.
- 📫 How to reach me: Preferably don't. Unless you are offering me money/job/cool project, in which case, please use email.
- 😄 Pronouns: who/am/i
- ⚡ Fun fact: I find psychology and AI to be quite similar. Neural nets are based on our brain itself. But they can't reason well, yet.
